      <h2>Section 3: Projects</h2>
      <p>This section includes all other work that was required during the course of the program, from drills and exercises to large, multi-week collaborative efforts. Not all work had deadlines, and most work was graded (insofar as it was graded at all) on the following scale:</p>
      <ul class="key">
        <li class="alert alert-danger">Not present, not turned in, or not conforming to the parameters of the assignment</li>
        <li class="alert alert-warning">Late or incomplete</li>
        <li class="alert alert-success">On time, present, sufficient, or good</li>
        <li class="alert alert-info">Exceeds expectations, meets stretch goals, or voted MVP by peers</li>
      </ul>
